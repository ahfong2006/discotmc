This example implements a USB combo device, with a USB TMC, and USB CDC-ACM
device.
 
The CDC-ACM interface is connected to USART2 (PA2/PA3) as in other examples, 
and the USBTMC interface allows some very very rudimentary control of the DAC
as a signal generator.
 
This example is heavily based on the existing usb_to_serial_rs485 demo
