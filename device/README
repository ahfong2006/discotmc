This is the main core application.  It contains the core SCPI parsing and
wave table generation code, and two (currently) platforms,
 * stm32f4 discovery board - The primary target, USB-TMC interface
 * "native" - this is helpful for testing the core code, provides a TCP
   server that understands SCPI commands.

This example implements a USB combo device, with a USB TMC, and USB CDC-ACM
device.
